## Installation 
Installation is fairly easy, place install_plugin.sh in your Minecraft server's folder (to keep track of it easily).
- Open up the file and change the directory for where your server is located to the address where you have your folder.
- Save the file and close the window.
- Find your .bashrc file on your computer (usually located in your home folder but hidden), open it up and scroll to the bottom, add this line to the end `. /path-to-mcserver/install_plugin.sh`
 (replace path-to-mcserver with your path.).
- Save, reopen any open terminals, enjoy.
